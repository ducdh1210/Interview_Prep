Refactoring
- Changing without changing more functionality
- Make name more descriptive
- Increase modularity

Test case
- JUnit
- Use case by hand

Need to differentiate code surgery vs refactoring (stretch / pull / continuous changes / small changes)

Refactoring names
- Extract method / Inline method
- Rename
- Move to a new package
- Extract constant
