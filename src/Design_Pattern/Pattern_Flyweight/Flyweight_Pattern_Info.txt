What is flyweight pattern and when to use it?

- Creating new objects (instances) by cloning (copying) other objects
- Allow for adding any subclass instance of known super class at run time
- When there are numerous potential classes that you want to only use if needed at runtime
- Reduce the need for creating subclasses
