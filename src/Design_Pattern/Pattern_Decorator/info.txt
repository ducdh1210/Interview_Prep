What is Decorator Pattern?
- Allows you to modify an object DYNAMICALLY
- You would use it when you want the capabilities of inheritance with subclasses, but you need to add
functionality at run time
- It is more flexible than inheritance
- Simplifies code because you add functionality using my simple classes
- Rather than rewrite old code you can extend with new code
